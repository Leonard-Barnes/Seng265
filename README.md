Concord files from my Seng 265 class

These files are project files I did in my Seng 265, Software Development Methods.
Each file contains the code to orgaized a serries of sentence into alphbectical order based on every word contained within each sentence.
The files get more advanced as new concepts were introduced troughout the course, and are writen in either python or C.
